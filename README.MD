# Makers PreCourse

For 4 weeks we were given resources and challenges to complete in order to prepare for the Makers full-time course.
I've decide to upload all the completed challenges to GitHub in order to review them later and assess my progress.

### Week 2 and 3 - Ruby mastery
All the challenges uploaded were worked on during that period.
It allowed me to train my Ruby skills and ensure I will be able to follow the course.
